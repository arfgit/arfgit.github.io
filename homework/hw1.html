            As We May Think <span class="author">(by Vannevar Bush)</span>
          </h2>

          <p class="summary-context">
            "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush was a nice read. Bush predicts
            the idea of the Web as he mentions the importance of building
            something that can capture and store all our knowledge as humans.
            Bush emphasizes the idea as "extending the human memory and the
            human ability to catalog, categorize, and recollect the totality of
            human information". Bush's concepts introduce the idea of "the
            memex" which pretty much simulates a computer setup. The memex
            contained two screens on it, switches and leavers, and magnetic tape
            for recording and storing data. If Bush could have seen the advances
            that technology made today, he would have been happy to find that
            the Web would live up to his visions and it would have been great to
            hear his thoughts on the types of modifications that could be made
            with our current setup since the access of information nowadays
            would not be so difficult as he originally thought back then.

          <h2>
            Long Live the Web
            <span class="author">(by Tim Berners-Lee)</span>
          </h2>
          <p class="summary-context">
            I found "Long Live the Web" by Tim Berners-Lee to be a good read.
            Tim Lee's views on the importance of the Web and the role it plays
            in society really brought out how little I knew about it. Most
            average users would not pay much mind to it, but I agree with Lee's
            opinion on the importance of keeping resources open-source and
            royal-free. I think it is important for everyone to understand the
            basic principles that Lee talks about, especially the one about
            making the internet openly accessible to everyone so that we can
            continue to bounce off ideas and knowledge with one another. One of
            Lee's quote that stood out to me was, “the goal of the Web is to
            serve humanity. We build it now so that those who come to it later
            will be able to create things that we cannot ourselves imagine.”
            This ties nicely with his opinions on keeping the web an open
            source, and really made me take for granted how much the web has
            evolved over the years and its importance of it. Comparing how the
            net was once it first started out with how it is now, really made me
            excited about the future possibilities/ideas that have yet to come
            into the light. All in all, I believe that protecting the
            fundamental principles of the Web and acting as such should be the
            primary focus of it all, but as long as greed is involved we are
            only really prolonging our own progress.
