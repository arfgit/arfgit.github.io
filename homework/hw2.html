          <p class="summary-context">
            I enjoyed reading Auriea Harvey's interview on how she transitioned
            into digital art after graduating as a sculptor and introduced
            digital art throughout all phases of the web. It was also cool to
            read about their VR projects and how you can see her passed
            sculpting skills get integrated into the 3D modeling VR world. It is
            great that Harvey has transitioned into making digital art in Web3.
            I am interested in seeing how Web3 will further develop digital art
            past the simple JPEGs that float around nowadays. It was pretty cool
            to read about what net.art was and read up a bit on the history of
            certain pieces that existed back when it first started to become a
            thing. I feel you can't really beat some of these works' old
            aesthetic vibe. Generating art with code is something that I find
            really fun to mess around with, and I look forward to creating
            interesting pieces.
